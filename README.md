# Flood-Analysis-Bangladesh

In June 2017, a heavy monsoon rain triggered a series of floods and landslides in Bangladesh, especially in Rangamati, Chittagong, and Bandarban - three hilly districts of Bangladesh - which resulted in the death of at least 152 people. The landslides were caused by a combination of factors, including incessant downpour, steep slopes, deforestation, and rapid urbanization. A study conducted after the event indicated that the large portion of the area was already highly susceptible to landslide due to existing factors and the intense rainfall acted as a triggering factor. Lack of land and poverty also forced many poor people to live in marginal areas where rents are low, including on landslide-prone hills (Reuters).
In this project, I am going to analyze the factors that predict how vulnerable each District (City & its administrative region), Upazila (Sub-Unit of District), and Union(village) in the flood-prone country on an existing datasets released by the Dutch Red Cross representing numerous statistics about a county's geography and determining how vulnerable they are to natural disasters. In addition, I am also going to look at flooding data from all existing geostations in Bangladesh using Geocoding-APIs and a dataset supplied by the Geostations. My ultimate goal is to see how a district/Upazila/Union's elevation and their proximity to rivers water levels affect their vulnerability to being flooded.
